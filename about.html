            <h1>About Steam Redesign</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>For this assignment, I chose the redesign the main page of the Steam platform to improve user experience
                and visual appeal. I focused on simplyfying the interface and making it easier to navigate. My goal was
                to create a calm, minimal, easy to navigate. A design that still represents steam brand but offer a
                smoother user experience. I wanted the redesign to feel familiar and welcoming to both new and returning
                users.</p>

            <p>I began by thinking about what a user typically wants to do when first landing on a store page, such as
                browsing new releases, searching for specific games, and accessing their library quickly, and check
                out Free to play game quickly. Because of that, I strutured the redesign around 5 main sections: Browse,
                Recommendations, Categories, Free to Play, and Sale. This makes the page easier to understand at a
                glance and support learnability because users can quickly recognize how the page is organized whether
                you are a old user or a new user</p>

            <p>For the colours, I chose a dark theme with shades of blue and gray to create a modern and immersive
                atmosphere. This color scheme not only aligns with Steam's branding but also reduces eye strain. This
                helps maintain strong constrast, which improves readability and user comfort during extended gaming
                sessions. A limited colour palette also reduces visual noise and helps users focus on the content without
                feeling overwhelmed. The muted backgrounds and bright accents contribute to a simple but modern
                aesthetic.</p>
            <p>My main goal was to make the interface simple and readable. I wanted a homepage where users can
                immediately understand what they are looking at without being overloaded. I used a clear “Featured
                Games” section at the top because most users expect to see popular or promoted titles first. I also
                focused on making the game cards easy to compare by giving them consistent spacing, image size, and a
                clear visual hierarchy such as title, info, price, button.</p>

            <p>For the font, I used Franklin Gothic Medium. This font are big, clean, and readable to most users. I used
                slightly bolder fonts to make it look more prominent and easier to scan than steam font which is thin and something hard to read with a lot going on the page. The consistent typography helps
                create a cohesive and professional look throughout the redesign.</p>
            <p>
                Compared to the real Steam homepage, I made several key changes. First, I removed cluttered elements
                like multiple carousels, huge banners, and too many categories all at once. Instead, I used simple headings and short navigation text so that users could focus on one part of the page at a time. I also relied on custom CSS rather than advanced Bootstrap utilities to match the level we were taught in class and to keep the layout more handcrafted and understandable. Another major change was in the color palette and overall tone. I stayed close to Steam’s original dark colors , but I used them in a more balanced way so the page doesn’t feel heavy. The bright blue highlights important elements like prices and interactions.
